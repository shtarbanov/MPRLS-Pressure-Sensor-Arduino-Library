  //a new pressure reading request is made. Now, we don't want to send a request to read all 4 bytes, because the
  //sensor may still be busy, so we want to just read the status byte first. And then after we have confirmed that
  //it is not busy, then we will send a request to read 4 bytes. Thus, the minimum number of bytes we will actually
  //read will be 5. This takes advantage of the fact that the sensor stops sending data when it sees the stop signal,
  //and then it starts sending data from byte 1 again, when a new read request is made.
  //(An alternative approach would be to simply request 4 bytes from the start, and if the sensor is busy send another
  //request for 4 bytes. In the case when sensor is not busy, this saves us from reading status byte twice, but in the
  //case when the sensor is busy, we are reading the last 3 bytes when we know they are invalid. Thus this approach
  //would be more wasteful.)
